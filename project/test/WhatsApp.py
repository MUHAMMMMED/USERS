 To achieve this, you'll need to use the WhatsApp Business API to send messages to the provided phone number. Here's how to modify your Django model and create a method to send the registration data via WhatsApp.

First, set up a WhatsApp Business Account and API Client following the official documentation: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/getting-started

After setting up the API client, you'll get access to a base_url (e.g., https://your-subdomain.whatsapp.com), an auth_token, and a phone_number for your WhatsApp Business Account.

Install the requests library to make HTTP requests to the WhatsApp API by running:

pip install requests
Modify your OffersBooking model and create a method to send the WhatsApp message:
import requests
from django.db import models
from phonenumber_field.modelfields import PhoneNumberField

class OffersBooking(models.Model):
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)
    message = models.CharField(max_length=300, blank=True, null=True)
    phone_number = PhoneNumberField()
    date = models.DateField(null=True)

    def send_whatsapp_message(self):
        # Replace these with your own credentials and phone number
        base_url = "https://your-subdomain.whatsapp.com/v1"
        auth_token = "your_auth_token"
        business_phone_number = "your_whatsapp_business_phone_number"

        headers = {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {auth_token}",
        }

        data = {
            "phone": str(self.phone_number),
            "body": f"New registration:\nName: {self.name}\nMessage: {self.message}\nDate: {self.date}",
        }

        url = f"{base_url}/messages?token={auth_token}"
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

        # Check if the request was successful
        if response.status_code == 201:
            print("Message sent successfully")
        else:
            print("Failed to send message")

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
        self.send_whatsapp_message()
This will send the registration data via WhatsApp every time an OffersBooking instance is saved. Note that you need to replace the base_url, auth_token, and business_phone_number with your own credentials.

Remember to follow WhatsApp's guidelines and policies when sending messages: https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy/
 
 
 
 
 # ==========================================
 To achieve this, you can use the Twilio API for WhatsApp to send a message to the user when they register. First, install the Twilio library:

pip install twilio
Then, you need to create a function that sends a WhatsApp message using the Twilio API. Add this function to your models.py file:

from twilio.rest import Client

def send_whatsapp_message(name, message, phone_number):
    account_sid = 'your_twilio_account_sid'
    auth_token = 'your_twilio_auth_token'
    client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

    from_whatsapp_number = 'whatsapp:your_twilio_whatsapp_number'
    to_whatsapp_number = f'whatsapp:{phone_number}'

    body = f"Hello {name},\n\n{message}\n\nRegards,\nYour Company"

    client.messages.create(
        body=body,
        from_=from_whatsapp_number,
        to=to_whatsapp_number
    )
Replace 'your_twilio_account_sid', 'your_twilio_auth_token', and 'your_twilio_whatsapp_number' with the appropriate values from your Twilio account.

Next, override the save method in your OffersBooking model to send a message when the instance is created:



class OffersBooking(models.Model):
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)
    Message = models.CharField(max_length=300, blank=True, null=True)
    phone_number = PhoneNumberField()
    date = models.DateField(null=True)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Set is_new to True if the instance doesn't have an id (it's being created)
        is_new = not self.pk
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)

        if is_new:
            send_whatsapp_message(self.name, self.Message, str(self.phone_number))

Now, when a new OffersBooking instance is created and saved, it will send a WhatsApp message to the specified phone number with the registration data.

Make sure to handle exceptions and errors appropriately in the send_whatsapp_message function to prevent issues with the

# ======================================================================
To sort data using the date before it after 2 days in Django and send a WhatsApp message containing the registration data to the number that was added with the data, you can use the following code:

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import requests
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import OffersBooking

def my_view(request):
    # get the current time with timezone information
    now = datetime.now()
    # add 2 days to the current date
    two_days_later = now + timedelta(days=2)
    # retrieve the data from the model and filter by date
    my_data = OffersBooking.objects.filter(date__lte=two_days_later).order_by('-date', '-time')
    # send WhatsApp message containing the registration data to the phone number

    for data in my_data:
        message = f"Name: {data.name}\nMessage: {data.Message}\nDate: {data.date}\nTime: {data.time}"
        phone_number = data.phone_number.as_e164
        send_whatsapp_message(phone_number, message)
    # pass the data to the template for rendering
    return render(request, 'my_template.html', {'my_data': my_data})



def send_whatsapp_message(phone_number, message):
    url = "https://api.chat-api.com/instance<instance_id>/message?token=<token>"
    data = {
        "phone": phone_number,
        "body": message
    }
    response = requests.post(url, data=data)
    return response.content



In this example, we first import the datetime module, the requests library, and the OffersBooking model. We then get the current time using datetime.now() and add 2 days to it using timedelta(days=2). Next, we retrieve the data from the OffersBooking model using OffersBooking.objects.filter() and filter it by date. We use two_days_later as the upper bound for the date filter, where we only retrieve the data that has a date less than or equal to 2 days later than the current date. Finally, we loop through the data and send a WhatsApp message containing the registration data to the phone number that was added with the data, using the send_whatsapp_message() function.

Note that this implementation assumes that you have set up a WhatsApp Business Account and obtained an API token from the WhatsApp Business API. You will also need to replace <instance_id> and <token> in the url variable with your actual instance ID and API token, respectively.
\
# =======================================
To set up a WhatsApp Business Account and obtain an API token from the WhatsApp Business API, you can follow these steps:

Go to the WhatsApp Business website (https://www.whatsapp.com/business/) and click on the "Download for free" button to download the WhatsApp Business app for your mobile device.

Install the WhatsApp Business app on your mobile device and create a new WhatsApp Business Account using your phone number.

Once you have created your WhatsApp Business Account, go to the WhatsApp Business API website (https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api) and click on the "Get started" button.

Follow the instructions to create a WhatsApp Business API Account and complete the verification process. You will need to provide your business details, agree to the terms and conditions, and go through a verification process to confirm your identity.

Once your WhatsApp Business API Account has been created and verified, you can obtain an API token by following the instructions provided in the WhatsApp Business API documentation (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/guides/account-setup/create-account).

To use the API token in your Django application, you can store it in a secure location, such as an environment variable or a configuration file. Then, you can retrieve the API token in your Django code and use it to make requests to the WhatsApp Business API.

Note that the WhatsApp Business API is a paid service and requires approval from WhatsApp before you can use it. You will also need to comply with the WhatsApp Business API Terms of Service and Facebook Platform Policy, which include restrictions on the types of messages you can send and the frequency of messages.

Messaging fees: WhatsApp charges messaging fees based on the destination country and the message type. The fees can vary between $0.005 and $0.09 per message, depending on the country and the message type (template or session message). Some BSPs may also charge additional fees for message delivery.

BSP fees: WhatsApp requires businesses to work with a BSP to use the WhatsApp Business API. BSPs may charge fees for their services, including account setup, integration, and support.

Development costs: Depending on your technical expertise and the complexity of your integration, you may need to hire developers or consultants to help you set up and maintain your integration with the WhatsApp Business API.

Infrastructure costs: You may need to invest in infrastructure, such as servers or cloud services, to handle the incoming and outgoing messages from the WhatsApp Business API.

It's important to note that WhatsApp requires businesses to sign a contract and commit to a minimum messaging volume to use the WhatsApp Business API. The minimum volume can vary depending on the BSP and the country. Additionally, WhatsApp may charge penalties or suspend your account if you violate their policies or abuse the service.

It's recommended that you work with a reputable BSP and carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of using the WhatsApp Business API before committing to the service.

In Django, you can create multiple custom user models by extending the AbstractBaseUser or AbstractUser classes provided by Django. Here's an example of how to create two custom user models: Customer and Employee.

First, let's create the two custom user models in the models.py file:

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager, PermissionsMixin

class CustomerManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        if not email:
            raise ValueError('The Email field must be set')
        email = self.normalize_email(email)
        user = self.model(email=email, **extra_fields)
        user.set_password(password)
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

    def create_superuser(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_staff', True)
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_superuser', True)
        return self.create_user(email, password, **extra_fields)


class Customer(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True, max_length=255)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    is_staff = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['name']

    objects = CustomerManager()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.email

class EmployeeManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        if not email:
            raise ValueError('The Email field must be set')
        email = self.normalize_email(email)
        user = self.model(email=email, **extra_fields)
        user.set_password(password)
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

    def create_superuser(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_staff', True)
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_superuser', True)
        return self.create_user(email, password, **extra_fields)




class Employee(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True, max_length=255)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    is_staff = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['name']

    objects = EmployeeManager()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.email
In this example, we define two custom user models: Customer and Employee. We extend the AbstractBaseUser class and the PermissionsMixin class, which provides the necessary fields and methods for authentication and authorization.

We also define two custom user managers: CustomerManager and EmployeeManager, which override the create_user() and create_superuser() methods to create users with the appropriate permissions.

In the Customer and Employee models, we define the necessary fields, including the email field, which is unique, and the name field, which is required. We also define the is_active and is_staff fields, which are used for authentication and authorization.

We set the USERNAME_FIELD to email, which is used for authentication, and the REQUIRED_FIELDS to name, which is required when creating a user.

Next, let's create views for each user model in the views.py file:

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required, user_passes_test
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

def customer_view(request):
    User = get_user_model()
    customers = User.objects.filter(is_staff=False)
    return render(request, 'customer.html', {'customers': customers})

@login_required(login_url='/login/')
@user_passes_test(lambda u: u.is_staff)
def employee_view(request):
    User = get_user_model()
    employees = User.objects.filter(is_staff=True)
    return render(request, 'employee.html', {'employees': employees})
In these views, we retrieve the custom user model using the get_user_model() function, and then filter the users based on whether they are a staff member or not.

The customer_view() function is accessible to all logged-in users and displays a list of customers, while the employee_view() function is only accessible to staff members and displays a list of employees.

Finally, we need to define the URLs for these views in the urls.py file:

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('customers/', views.customer_view, name='customer_view'),
    path('employees/', views.employee_view, name='employee_view'),
]
In this example, we define two URLs: /customers/ and /employees/, which map to the customer_view() and employee_view() functions, respectively.


===
--------------------------------------------\
Sure, here's some more information on creating and using multiple custom user models in Django.

When creating multiple custom user models, it's important to keep in mind that each model should extend either the AbstractBaseUser or AbstractUser classes, as these classes provide the necessary fields and methods for authentication and authorization.

The AbstractBaseUser class provides a bare minimum implementation for authentication, while the AbstractUser class provides additional features such as permissions and groups. You can choose which class to extend based on your requirements.

To create a custom user model, you'll need to define the necessary fields for your model, such as email, username, password, etc. You can also define additional fields that are specific to your application.

Next, you'll need to create a custom user manager that extends either the BaseUserManager or UserManager class. This manager will be responsible for creating and managing users for your custom user model.

In the manager, you'll need to override the create_user() and create_superuser() methods to create users with the appropriate permissions. You can also define additional methods as needed.

Once you've defined your custom user model and manager, you'll need to specify the model in your Django settings file by setting the AUTH_USER_MODEL variable to the path of your custom user model.

For example, if you have a custom user model called Customer in a users app, you would set the AUTH_USER_MODEL variable in your settings file like this:

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'users.Customer'
Once you've set the AUTH_USER_MODEL variable, you can use the standard Django authentication views and forms to authenticate and authorize users for your custom user model.

To access and manage users for your custom user model in your views, you can use the get_user_model() function provided by Django, which returns the user model specified in your settings file.

For example, to retrieve all customers in a Customer view, you could do the following:

from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

def customer_view(request):
    User = get_user_model()
    customers = User.objects.filter(is_staff=False)
    # do something with the customers queryset
In this example, we retrieve the Customer model using the get_user_model() function and filter the users based on whether they are a staff member or not.

You can also use the @login_required and @user_passes_test decorators provided by Django to control access to your views based on authentication and authorization.

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required, user_passes_test

@login_required(login_url='/login/')
@user_passes_test(lambda u: u.is_staff)
def employee_view(request):
    User = get_user_model()
    employees = User.objects.filter(is_staff=True)
    # do something with the employees queryset
In this example, we use the @login_required decorator to ensure that only logged-in users can access the view, and the @user_passes_test decorator to ensure that only staff members can access the view.

Overall, creating and using multiple custom user models in Django requires careful consideration of your application's requirements, but can provide a powerful and flexible authentication and authorization system.


how to use custom user with any ather models with relation

If you have a custom user model in Django and you want to create a relationship with another model, you can use a foreign key or a one-to-one field to establish the relationship.

Here's an example of how to establish a one-to-many relationship between a custom user model called MyUser and a model called Book.

First, let's define the MyUser model in the models.py file:

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager

class MyUserManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        if not email:
            raise ValueError('The Email field must be set')
        email = self.normalize_email(email)
        user = self.model(email=email, **extra_fields)
        user.set_password(password)
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

    def create_superuser(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_staff', True)
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_superuser', True)
        return self.create_user(email, password, **extra_fields)

class MyUser(AbstractBaseUser):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True, max_length=255)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    is_staff = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['name']

    objects = MyUserManager()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.email
In this example, we define a custom user model called MyUser that extends the AbstractBaseUser class. We also define a custom user manager called MyUserManager that overrides the create_user() and create_superuser() methods to create users with the appropriate permissions.

Next, let's define the Book model, which will have a one-to-many relationship with MyUser:

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    author = models.ForeignKey(MyUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
In this example, we define a Book model with a title field and a ForeignKey to the MyUser model. The on_delete argument specifies what should happen when a user is deleted - in this case, we're using models.CASCADE to delete all books associated with the user.

To create a book for a specific user, you can do the following:

from myapp.models import MyUser, Book

# get the user
user = MyUser.objects.get(email='user@example.com')

# create a book for the user
book = Book.objects.create(title='A Great Book', author=user)
In this example, we retrieve the MyUser object with the email address user@example.com, and then create a new Book object with the title set to 'A Great Book' and the author set to the MyUser object.

To retrieve all books for a specific user, you can do the following:

# get the user
user = MyUser.objects.get(email='user@example.com')

# get all books for the user
books = Book.objects.filter(author=user)
In this example, we retrieve the MyUser object with the email address user@example.com, and then filter the Book objects by the author field to get all books associated with that user.

Overall, using a custom user model with other models in Django is similar to using the built-in User model - you can establish relationships using foreign keys or one-to-one fields and manipulate the related objects using standard Django querysets and methods.


# ========================================
Online Appointment Booking System - Django

To create an online booking system that reduces waste and increases appointments using Django, you can follow these steps:

Requirements:

Python3
Django
Django REST Framework

Celery
Redis

Twilio (for WhatsApp messaging)
Step 1: Create a new Django project and app

Create a new Django project:

django-admin startproject appointment_booking_system

Create a new Django app called "bookings":

cd appointment_booking_system
python manage.py startapp bookings
Step 2: Set up models

Create models for your appointments and customers in bookings/models.py.

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Customer(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=15)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.user.username

class Appointment(models.Model):
    customer = models.ForeignKey(Customer, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    start_time = models.DateTimeField()
    end_time = models.DateTimeField()
    is_paid = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.customer.user.username} - {self.start_time} - {self.end_time}"

Step 3: Set up Django REST Framework

Install Django REST Framework:

pip install djangorestframework
Add 'rest_framework' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.

Create serializers for your models in bookings/serializers.py.

from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Customer, Appointment

class CustomerSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Customer
        fields = '__all__'


class AppointmentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Appointment
        fields = '__all__'

Create views for your API in bookings/views.py.
from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Customer, Appointment
from .serializers import CustomerSerializer, AppointmentSerializer


class CustomerListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Customer.objects.all()
    serializer_class = CustomerSerializer


class AppointmentListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Appointment.objects.all()
    serializer_class = AppointmentSerializer


Create URL endpoints for your API in bookings/urls.py.
from django.urls import path
from .views import CustomerListCreateView, AppointmentListCreateView

urlpatterns = [
    path('customers/', CustomerListCreateView.as_view(), name='customer_list_create'),
    path('appointments/', AppointmentListCreateView.as_view(), name='appointment_list_create'),
]

Include your app's URLs in the main urls.py.
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('bookings.urls')),
]
Step 4: Set up Celery for background tasks

Install Celery and Redis:

pip install celery[redis]
Configure Celery in a new file celery.py in the project directory:

import os
from celery import Celery
from django.conf import settings

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'appointment_booking_system.settings')
app = Celery('appointment_booking_system')

app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')
app.autodiscover_tasks(lambda: settings.INSTALLED_APPS)
Update __init__.py in the project directory:
from .celery import app as celery_app

__all__ = ('celery_app',)
Add Celery settings to settings.py:
CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379'
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379'
Step 5: Set up Twilio for WhatsApp messaging

Install the Twilio library:

pip install twilio
Set up Twilio credentials in settings.py.

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_account_sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_auth_token'
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = 'your_twilio_phone_number'
Create a new file tasks.py in your bookings app directory:
from celery import shared_task
from twilio.rest import Client
from django.conf import settings

@shared_task
def send_whatsapp_message(to, body):
    client = Client(settings.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, settings.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)
    message = client.messages.create(
        body=body
