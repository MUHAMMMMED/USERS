To sort data using the date before it after 5 hours in Django, you can use the datetime module to manipulate the date and time values. Here's an example implementation in a view:

from datetime import timedelta
from django.utils import timezone
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import MyModel

def my_view(request):
    # get the current time with timezone information
    now = timezone.now()
    # subtract 5 hours from the current time
    five_hours_ago = now - timedelta(hours=5)
    # retrieve the data from the model and filter by date
    my_data = MyModel.objects.filter(date__gte=five_hours_ago).order_by('-date')
    # pass the data to the template for rendering
    return render(request, 'my_template.html', {'my_data': my_data})
In this example, we first get the current time with timezone information using timezone.now(). We then subtract 5 hours from the current time using timedelta(hours=5) to get a datetime that is 5 hours earlier. We then use MyModel.objects.filter() to retrieve the data from the model and filter by date, where we only retrieve the data that has a date greater than or equal to 5 hours ago. Finally, we sort the data by date in descending order using .order_by('-date').

Note that this implementation assumes that your model has a field named date that stores datetime values. You may need to adjust the field name and filtering criteria to match your specific use case.

To sort data using the date before it after 5 hours in Django with the OffersBooking model, you can modify the previous code snippet as follows:

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import OffersBooking

def my_view(request):
    # get the current time with timezone information
    now = datetime.now()
    # subtract 5 hours from the current time
    five_hours_ago = now - timedelta(hours=5)
    # retrieve the data from the model and filter by date and time
    my_data = OffersBooking.objects.filter(date__gte=five_hours_ago.date(), time__gte=five_hours_ago.time()).order_by('-date', '-time')
    # pass the data to the template for rendering
    return render(request, 'my_template.html', {'my_data': my_data})
In this example, we first import the datetime module and the OffersBooking model. We then get the current time using datetime.now() and subtract 5 hours from it using timedelta(hours=5). Next, we retrieve the data from the OffersBooking model using OffersBooking.objects.filter() and filter it by date and time. We use five_hours_ago.date() and five_hours_ago.time() to get the date and time components separately. Finally, we sort the data by date in descending order and then by time in descending order using .order_by('-date', '-time').

Note that this implementation assumes that you have imported PhoneNumberField from phonenumber_field and added it to your INSTALLED_APPS setting. Also, make sure to adjust the field names and filtering criteria as per your specific use case.

To sort data using the date before it after 2 days in Django with the OffersBooking model, you can modify the previous code snippet as follows:

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import OffersBooking

def my_view(request):
    # get the current time with timezone information
    now = datetime.now()
    # add 2 days to the current date
    two_days_later = now + timedelta(days=2)
    # retrieve the data from the model and filter by date
    my_data = OffersBooking.objects.filter(date__lte=two_days_later).order_by('-date', '-time')
    # pass the data to the template for rendering
    return render(request, 'my_template.html', {'my_data': my_data})
In this example, we first import the datetime module and the OffersBooking model. We then get the current time using datetime.now() and add 2 days to it using timedelta(days=2). Next, we retrieve the data from the OffersBooking model using OffersBooking.objects.filter() and filter it by date. We use two_days_later as the upper bound for the date filter, where we only retrieve the data that has a date less than or equal to 2 days later than the current date. Finally, we sort the data by date in descending order and then by time in descending order using .order_by('-date', '-time').

Note that this implementation assumes that you have imported PhoneNumberField from phonenumber_field and added it to your INSTALLED_APPS setting. Also, make sure to adjust the field names and filtering criteria as per your specific use case.
